# Install Dlib on Ubuntu

This is a bash script to install the latest version of Dlib on an Ubuntu machine.
You just need to execute the bash file in terminal and it takes care of everything.

$ chmod +x install_dlib.sh

$ ./install_dlib.sh
 

It also includes two bash files to compile dlib C++ codes and codes with both Dlib and OpenCV libraries:

$ ./compile_dlib.sh   myDlibCode.cpp

$ ./compile_opencv_dlib.sh   myOpenCvDlibCode.cpp
